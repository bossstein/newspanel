Welcome to NewsPanel. NewsPanel is a simple demo web app. Once you have NewsPanel up and running you can create view, create and edit articles. NewsPanel can also recieve a request and return an xml file to populate a potential future application.

News panel has a few prerequisites:

- **Python 3**: NewsPanel is written in python. ensure you have an up to date installation of python on your machine. Any up to date version of Python should work but Python 3 is recommended. Follow the instructions as given [here ](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
- **Pip 3** : Pip or Pip 3 are used to install Python and Python 3 modules respectively. If you have installed Python 3 then a version of pip3 should be packaged along with it. If you are determined to not use python 3 then install pip [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
- **Django** : Django is a Python framework for developing web applications. With pip3 it should be as simple as entering ```pip3 install Django```. Find further details of how to install django [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release).
- **SQLite3** : SQLite3 is a basic database engine. Luckily it coms packaged in Python by default. In case of any issues however look [here](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) (official docs) or [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm) (more readable tutorial).

Once all of the above are in place it is time to get going with NewsPanel. If you are reading this you have likely already downloaded the source code from the [git hub page](https://github.com/bossstein/newspanel) and unzipped the file in you desired location.
